# code-experiment

Welcome to **code-experiment** — my personal developer playground where I test, learn, and explore new technologies, tools, and concepts.

This repo is not a production project or client work. Instead, it’s a collection of isolated experiments, demos, and mini-projects designed to help me understand and practice different stacks and patterns. Each folder contains a focused experiment or learning module, often with a clear README and working code.

---

## Why this repo exists

- Avoids cluttering my GitHub with tons of tiny repos
- Keeps all learning material in one accessible place
- Helps me track progress and revisit past experiments
- Provides a sandbox to safely try new ideas without fear

---

## How it’s organized

- Each technology, tool, or concept gets its own folder
- Folders are independent, minimal setups focused on a specific topic
- Experiment folders typically include usage instructions and notes

---

## 📁 Projects

Each folder is a focused experiment or learning sandbox.

- [`mst-dexie`](./mst-dexie) — — modular MST + Dexie setup featuring nested models, hydration, lifecycle hooks, and full offline CRUD — built for real-world structure

More coming soon...

---

## What you’ll find here

- State management experiments (e.g., MST, MobX)
- IndexedDB & Dexie demos
- Frontend libraries and frameworks (React, Next.js, etc.)
- Animations and UI interaction tests
- Backend learning playgrounds (if any)
- And whatever else I’m curious about

---

## How to use

Feel free to browse or clone this repo to explore any experiments. Each folder should be self-contained and runnable independently.

---

## Disclaimer

This is a personal learning repo — code quality, completeness, and structure vary per experiment. Use it as inspiration or reference, not production-ready code.

Happy coding! 🚀
